# Photography Notes: Shooting a Sea Bridge

Went to the seaside to photograph a sea bridge, experimenting with different compositions and zoom levels. Here are three techniques I practiced, along with example shots and key takeaways.

## Technique 1: 4x Zoom + Half Composition

**Settings:**
- Zoom: **4x**
- Composition: Place the bridge at the **1/2 line** (horizontal center)
- Post-processing: Adjust filters and style to taste

**Key Points:**
1. 4x zoom pulls the bridge closer, revealing structural details
2. The bridge divides the frame in half — sky above, sea below
3. This creates a **calm, symmetrical** atmosphere
4. Lowering saturation and boosting contrast adds a refined, muted look

**Example:**

<img src="img/sea04.jpg" alt="4x zoom half composition" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />

> The bridge sits at the midline between sky and sea. 4x zoom brings the subject close, while the half-split composition keeps things clean and balanced.

## Technique 2: 6x Zoom + Lower Quarter Composition

**Settings:**
- Zoom: **6x**
- Composition: Place the bridge at the **lower 1/4** of the frame
- Post-processing: Adjust filters based on personal preference

**Key Points:**
1. 6x zoom compresses the scene further — vehicles and structural details become visible
2. Placing the bridge at the lower quarter leaves generous sky, creating a sense of **vastness and openness**
3. Works especially well with interesting cloud formations
4. Adjust filters to match the mood — more contrast for overcast days, more vibrance for sunny skies

**Example:**

<img src="img/sea01.jpg" alt="6x zoom lower quarter composition" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />

> 6x zoom makes the bridge more prominent. Positioned at the lower quarter, the expansive sky above creates a feeling of openness and breathing room.

## Technique 3: 4x Zoom + Bridge with Tree Framing

**Settings:**
- Zoom: **4x**
- Composition: Place the tree on the **right side**, bridge at the **lower 1/3**
- Post-processing: Balance the tones between foreground and background

**Key Points:**
1. Use shoreline trees as foreground elements to add **depth and layers**
2. The bridge on the lower third line follows the classic **rule of thirds**
3. Tree branches create a **natural frame**, guiding the eye toward the bridge
4. Foreground (tree) + midground (sea) + background (bridge) = complete spatial depth
5. Focus on the bridge and let the tree remain as a silhouette or softly blurred element

**Examples:**

<img src="img/sea03.jpg" alt="Bridge with tree framing example 1" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />

<img src="img/sea02.jpg" alt="Bridge with tree framing example 2" style="max-width: 520px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 12px;" />

> Tree branches on the right serve as a natural frame. The bridge sits at the lower third, creating clear layers. Two shots from slightly different angles show how natural elements enrich the composition.

## Composition Summary

| Technique | Zoom | Bridge Position | Feel | Best For |
|-----------|------|----------------|------|----------|
| Half split | 4x | Center 1/2 | Calm, symmetric | Calm sea, clean sky |
| Negative space | 6x | Lower 1/4 | Open, expansive | Layered sky, clouds |
| Frame composition | 4x | Lower 1/3 | Layered, deep | Shoreline with trees |

## Takeaways

1. **Composition is everything** — the same scene tells a different story with a different frame
2. **Use zoom wisely** — telephoto compression makes distant subjects stand out
3. **Foreground matters** — adding branches or foliage dramatically increases depth
4. **Shoot more, experiment more** — try multiple angles at the same spot; surprises happen
5. **Edit with restraint** — filters should enhance, not overpower

> Photography is an art of constant practice. Every click of the shutter is a chance to learn.
